In this project we are to rate the similarity between two passages. Its use case is to automatically
grade exams. A template passage will be provided against which our algorithm must compare the
answers from different students and yeild a score telling how similar they are. Based on this score,
an automatic grading system can be set up.

To reproduce these results first create individual .txt files for each of the passages. Then run
the command
~~~
python Group 13.py (path to txt1) (path to txt2)
~~~
It will print the similarity score obtained

You can read more about the overall approach used to solve this problem in our [report](https://github.com/aryanpandey/CH5019-Project/blob/main/Group_13.pdf)
